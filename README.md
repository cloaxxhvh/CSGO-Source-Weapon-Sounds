# CSGO-Source-Weapon-Sounds
This is a repost of Coronavirus' lua
Reposting as topic closed and the github links didn't work.

Features
- All weapons are supported
- Ragebot and manual sounds changed
- Changeable sound volume

How to install
1 - Download all files from above
2 - Drag lua in like normal
3 - Put both folders in the .zip into "Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\sound"
4 - All done!

Again all credits go to Coronavirus, none of this work is mine I only re-uploaded it so fellow skeeters can use it
